⚖️ **Sellers** can create a Pool using their own Tokens on the platform, freely setting the USDT price, sales volume and other parameters, and supporting flexible token input and withdrawal. Sellers can also set a maximum sales volume and control the price strategy at different stages to better manage the sales process.

💸 **Buyers** can conveniently purchase Tokens on the platform by finding Pools through addresses and settling with USDT according to the Pool price, ensuring a safe and reliable purchase.

📊 This platform provides a corresponding solution for sellers and Token issuers who wish to sell Tokens at a fixed price, achieving more efficient, rapid, and sustainable Token trading.
